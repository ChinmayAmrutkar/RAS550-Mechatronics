### Team Submission  

This lab demonstrates real-time embedded control on the **Arduino Uno** board using **MATLAB Simulink (R2025a)**.  

### Tasks Completed  
1. **Simulink Model for LED Control**  
   - Developed a Simulink model to toggle the LED on the Arduino Uno.  
   - Implemented real-time execution via *Embedded Real-Time Control*.  
   - A screenshot and GIF of the Simulink model are included in this submission.

2. **Data Collection**  
   - Time data and pulse data were collected through the Uno board using Simulink data logging tools.  
   - The collected signals verify correct operation of the embedded control loop.

3. **Demonstration Video**  
   - A short **30-second video** is included, showing the live setup on the Arduino Uno.  
   - The video highlights LED toggling and real-time data collection.  
   - Only one video is submitted per team, as required.
